In this project, users can display a Sankey diagram showing the flows of mineral resources, such as silver, platinum, and rare earth elements, between countries using international trade data. The diagram is interactive, allowing users to choose any metal resource, year, and the number of countries to display in total. In the second diagram, uses can select additional countries of interest, enabling them to grasp the full picture of mineral resource flows and analyze them in depth. This will help research the ubiquity and sources of supply of important resources, which are fundamental to our economy and society.
